Start with these libraries, in the recommended order. For each, start by creating a new notebook in your fork of this repo - then try to walk through the quickstart tutorial step-by-step, to get a sense of what the library does and how it works.</p> <p>Important | To start using these libraries, you will first need to install them in your development environment. Look for installation instructions that use <code>pip</code> - and add those libraries to the requirements.txt file if absent. Rebuild container - and you should be ready to go.</p> Library Description Quickstart NumPy Numerical computing with Python Quickstart Tutorial Pandas Data manipulation and analysis Getting Started Matplotlib Data visualization (static + interactive) Quickstart - Depth Seaborn Data visualization (matplotlib-based) Quickstart - Depth Scikit-learn Machine learning in Python (Core) Quickstart - Depth TensorFlow Machine learning in Python (E2E) Quickstart  - Depth PyTorch Machine learning in Python (CV, NLP) Quickstart - Msft Bokeh Interactive visualizations in Python Quickstart - Depth <p>This is not a comprehensive list - feel free to add more to the list as you skill up, based on the goals you are driving towards in usage.</p>"},{"location":"#7-learning-resources","title":"7 | Learning Resources","text":"<p>These are resources I recommend for skilling up on these topics.
